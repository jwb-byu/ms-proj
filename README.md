## LLM Acknowledgement

This project was completed with the aid of LLM's including ChatGPT and Google Search AI Overview. LLM assistance included providing explanations while studying project content, reminding function call syntax, and helping with technical writing. This project demonstrates my best efforts to learn through the project while using LLM's to expedite repetitive work, increase productivity, and access information.
