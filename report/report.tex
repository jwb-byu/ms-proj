This masters project aims to leverage data science techniques, including graph data-scientific and machine learning approaches, to improve the existing toolset for identification of micro-connectomic subgraphs. In 1986 John White, Sydney Brenner, and their team in England circuitry will provide insight into high-level behavioral function and nervous system disease.
