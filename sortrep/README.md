# sortrep

The objective of this package is to replicate and validate the International Brain Lab's spike-sorting pipeline. In this project:

- I will build an automation to:

    1. Pull samples of their raw data
    2. Process the data in an anlygous spike-sorting algorithm (e.g,. KiloSort)
    3. Compare my results to the processing results on IBL's ALF, determining if my processing pipeline is virtually identical to IBL's.

- I will also write a jupyter notebook documenting this process.
